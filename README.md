Garage Management System - Detailed
Documentation
1.	Ideation Phase
The idea for the Garage Management System arises from the common issues faced in traditional garages, where most daily tasks such as customer data management, billing, service status tracking, and spare parts inventory are handled manually. Manual records lead to errors, misplaced job cards, delayed servicing, and customer dissatisfaction. Hence, the ideation phase focuses on designing a system that simplifies operations, provides real-time vehicle service tracking, maintains service history logs, and generates accurate bills efficiently.
Key Objectives
•	Reduce paperwork and manual errors.
•	Maintain centralized customer and vehicle records.
•	Track service jobs and mechanic assignments.
•	Automate billing and spare part usage tracking.
 
2.	Project Planning Phase
The planning phase outlines the workflow for development, team responsibilities, timeline, and resources.
Project Scope
The system will handle: - Customer and Vehicle Registration - Service Job Creation - Mechanic Assignment -
Spare Parts Management - Invoice Generation - Report Creation
